[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how)

The article highlights the significance of well-crafted Git commit messages in software development. It begins by comparing two sets of commit messages, one from the past that is messy and inconsistent and another from more recent times that is concise and clear. The article emphasizes that while many repositories suffer from unclear commit messages, notable exceptions like the Linux kernel, Git itself, and repositories managed by Tim Pope maintain excellent commit message practices. The article argues that good commit messages are essential for communicating context about code changes to both fellow developers and future maintainers, and it points out that a commit message can explain "why" a change was made, whereas a code diff only shows "what" changed. The article then delves into the seven rules for writing great Git commit messages, including separating the subject from the body with a blank line, limiting the subject line to 50 characters, capitalizing the subject line, not ending the subject line with a period, using the imperative mood in the subject line, wrapping the body at 72 characters, and using the body to explain "what" and "why" instead of "how." Finally, it encourages developers to embrace the command line for Git operations, as it offers greater control and power compared to IDE integrations.

### Harry's Comment
- Keeping commit messages consistent in format is a key aspect of group work that I am guilty of ignoring. This article did a great job of providing humorous and relevant examples of bad commit practices, I will be making a point to be more thoughtful moving forward. Great article!
